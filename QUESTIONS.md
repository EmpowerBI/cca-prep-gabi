|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-29 | Iulian | Why does `npm --version` fail with "running scripts is disabled"? | PowerShell's default execution policy blocks scripts; `npm` is one. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once, or use `npm.cmd`. See `SETUP.md` §3. | Setup |
| 2026-09-29 | Iulian | If two branches change different parts of the same file, how does Git merge them? | Git compares each branch to the common starting commit (merge base) and applies both sets of line changes. Only when both touch the *same* lines does it stop and ask a human to resolve the conflict. See `GITHUB-AND-PIPELINE-CONCEPTS.md` §4. | Git |
